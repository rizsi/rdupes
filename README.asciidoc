# rdupes

Find duplicate files and show them in an interactive GUI.

Typical usage is to find and remove duplicates in a backup folder or to check whether files in a machine are backed up already or not.

## Features

Visits recursively all files within the root folders and finds the ones with similar size and md5 sum.

Symlinks are ignored either for folders and files. (They are not visited and shown just as if they were not there.)

Shows the files in a tree view. The tree view is automatically refreshed when the files are updated in the file system.

## Planned features

 * Also find similar folders - hash of folder is the hash of the files in alphabetic filename order
 * Show sub-collisions in the root folder. Just like error markers are propagated upwards in tree-editors
 * Possibility to mark duplicates as accepted. (Maybe a simple ignore file would make it.)
 * Add/remove folders dynamically without restart. This is important because restart means re-hashing all the files.
 * Multithreaded hash counting using effective java.nio API of MessageDigest
 * Opening multiple views is possible.
 * File commands:
 ** delete, move, etc
 ** Delete all files within a folder which are present in an other folder: these files are already backud up. The others can be added to the backup.
 ** Visiting, hash counting, etc is done on background thread and progress feedback is shown in the main window.
