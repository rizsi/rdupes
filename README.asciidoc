# rdupes

Find duplicate files and show them in an interactive GUI.

Typical usage is to find and remove duplicates in a backup folder or to check whether files in a machine are backed up already or not.

## Features

 * Visits recursively all files within the root folders and finds the ones with similar size and md5 sum.
 * Symlinks are ignored either for folders and files. (They are not visited and shown just as if they were not there.)
 * Shows the files in a tree view. The tree view is automatically refreshed when the files are updated in the file system.
 * Show sub-collisions in the root folder. Just like error markers are propagated upwards in tree-editors. Number of sub-collisions is marked.
 * Possibility to ignore files (can be used mark duplicates as accepted). .rdupesignore files are handled as gitignore files in git.
 * Add/remove folders dynamically without restart. This is important because restart means re-hashing all the files.
 * Opening multiple views is possible. Useful when two folders are reviewed simultaneously.
 * Multithreaded hash counting using effective java.nio API of MessageDigest
 * Folders visiting, hash counting, etc is done on background thread and progress feedback is shown in the main window.
 * Feedback of heap allocation and GC on request
 * Deleting duplicates is possible by moving to a "trash" folder which is set up on the root folder. Action is accessible as a context menu.

## Planned features

 * Also find similar folders - hash of folder is the hash of the files in alphabetic filename order
 * File commands:
 ** delete, move, etc
 ** Delete all files within a folder which are present in an other folder: these files are already backud up. The others can be added to the backup.
